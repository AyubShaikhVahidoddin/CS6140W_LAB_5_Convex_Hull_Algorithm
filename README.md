The Convex Hull Algorith is implemented and the code is in the C++ language.
code File name - ConvexHull.cpp

I HAVE DID THIS Code and is compiled and I have uploded code in this online Compiler https://onlinegdb.com/GX_7UaSKb 
Just click on this link(https://onlinegdb.com/GX_7UaSKb  ) it will take you to the project there you can directly RUN the program i have uploded same code in this compiler you can check the code same as in git repo it was creted by me so that it is easy for you sir to verify instead downloading the exe sometime it block by antivirus so problem to running .exe or creating .exe. please check and let me know in case any issue üëç **

Time Complexity: 
 The algorithm takes O(n Log n) time .
( n be the number of input points.)
